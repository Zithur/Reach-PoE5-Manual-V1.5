RT-PoE5 Variations
------------------

The PoE5 is available in a 24-port configuration, or in an 8-port configuration.
All ‘number of port’ references in this manual show the full 24 ports, but the
8-port models are limited to eight ports. There are no differences between the
24-port model and the 8-port model other than the number of ports.
