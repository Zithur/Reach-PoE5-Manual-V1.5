Serial Console
--------------

>   The serial console port is located at the rear of the unit. It is an RJ-45
>   with a three-wire RS-232 level interface. The interface has the same pinout
>   as found on Cisco routers and switches. The baud rate factory default is
>   115200, 1 stop, no parity, 8 bits. The baud rate can be changed by software
>   command â€“ see the [BAUD](#_BAUD) command in the Command Reference section.
>   Characters are echoed as they are typed (full duplex).
